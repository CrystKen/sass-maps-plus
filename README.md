## Sass Maps Plus

These functions provide advanced native map (and list-map) data-type manipulation and inspection in all current versions (compilers) of Sass. They are the successor to my [Sass Listâ€“Maps] repository, and as such compatible with both [libsass (as of version 3.1)](http://libsass.org/) and [ruby-sass (as of version 3.3)](http://sass-lang.com/).
