## Sass Maps Plus

These functions are under development. They are the successor to my [Sass Listâ€“Maps] repository, and as such intended to provide advanced native map (and list-map) data-type manipulation and inspection in all current versions (compilers) of Sass: this means [libsass (as of version 3.1)](http://libsass.org/) and [ruby-sass (as of version 3.3)](http://sass-lang.com/).

TODO: finish the functions, finish this README.
