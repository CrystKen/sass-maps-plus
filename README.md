## Sass Maps Plus

These functions are under development. They are the successor to my [Sass Listâ€“Maps](http://github.com/lunelson/sass-list-maps) project, and as such provide advanced native map (and list-map) data-type manipulation and inspection in all current versions (compilers) of Sass: this means [libsass (as of version 3.1)](http://libsass.org/) and [ruby-sass (as of version 3.3)](http://sass-lang.com/).
